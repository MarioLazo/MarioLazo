# Mario Lazo

> *"AI should accelerate human capability — and grow our hearts to be better people."*

I'm a **Data & AI Solution Architect** based in Austin, Texas — grounded in rigorous research, driven by problems worth solving.

After a decade working in stealth mode across healthcare, finance, and enterprise operations — building award winning AI Workflows and 230+ agents, failing forward, and learning what actually works — I'm now sharing my field notes openly. **Because the biggest problems we face — poverty, disease, inequity — won't be solved by keeping knowledge locked away.**

I believe AI must balance **the mind and the heart**. Technical rigor matters. So does building systems that serve people, not just metrics.

## 🔬 Active Research — Seeking Contributors

*These aren't side projects. They're ongoing research and learning initiatives where I'm actively seeking collaborators — developers, domain experts, researchers, and writers willing to do the difficult work of building real, useful, smart, governed agents.*

### 🏭 [Agent Factory Reference](https://github.com/MarioLazo/agent-factory-reference)
![Contributors Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributors-welcome-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

**Curating resources and assets to build the Agentic Factory in highly regulated industries** — healthcare, finance, and supply chain — where domain expertise is critical and governance isn't optional.

The practitioner's reference: clean, searchable, no jargon. Covers the operating model, orchestration, and observability needed to scale agents beyond pilot purgatory.

### 📚 [RAG Production Guide](https://github.com/MarioLazo/rag-production-guide)
![Contributors Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributors-welcome-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

**My personal guide as a solution architect — now open to all.** A compiled list of applied experience in intelligent document processing, agents, and research over the past 6 years.

Battle-tested RAG: common failure modes, architecture decisions that don't survive contact with reality, and patterns that actually hold up in production.
